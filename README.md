# StackScripts
Linode StackScripts. Most but not necessarily all of these StackScripts will be published to the [Linode StackScript Directory](https://www.linode.com/stackscripts) as official Linode StackScripts.

##Contributing
See `stackscripts/0/` as an example of how StackScripts can be contributed to this repository.

##To-do
There will be a collection of nested directories ending in symlinks that will provide a way to discover and please StackScripts into categories in this repository. This will become apparent once more StackScripts are in the repository as Git won't simply retain empty directories.

##License
StackScripts is released under the GNU General Public License v2 and later. See the bundled LICENSE file for details.
